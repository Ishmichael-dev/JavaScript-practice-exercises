# JavaScript-practice-exercises
This is the training ground for JavaScript where I'll be doing multiple exercises on different things in order to sharpen my skills and gain more experience in this programming language
I'm trying to do those exercises but in case I learn a new modern and clean way do a certain exercise, I will commit the changes to the existing one and replace it with a clean and concise code
